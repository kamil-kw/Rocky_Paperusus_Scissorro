A font of my choice is Poppins provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), as alternative font to Poopins, I used sans serif font.

* **Middle section (About me, Resume, Contact):**

    Scale to fit most popular devices, added grey transparent background to separate form page background, heading is visually separated by double underline.
    Per page:
    * **About me** - short sentence with quote for visitors.
    * **Resume** - work history in easy to read form, job title automatically set to uppercase, company and work time frames with underline decoration to provide clear separation from main text;

## 5. Development

I tried multiple layouts & elements in my second respiratory to provide the most user friendly interface. The design of the website and the content was created by myself, there were no design bots used to help with development.
I have defined responsive breakpoints based on the percentage of the most popular devices screen size used in 2021.

The code was reviewed multiple times to ensure all dead codes are cleaned, and it's readable for the other testers/ users.
CSS code was cleaned and condensed (in total over 200 lines of CSS code lines were removed).
Code has been runned by HTML/ CSS beautifier to improve code outlook. 


* **All pages:**
 
During the first days of the project I did use different pictures for positioning, however I changed it later to my own picture.

Original design was with only a grey color background. I have changed that recently to provide a more complimentary photo to the hero image. Based on that, I was able to apply a grey transparent box to highlight the text section.
